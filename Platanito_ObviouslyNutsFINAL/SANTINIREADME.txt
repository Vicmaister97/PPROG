Hi Santini, we hope you enjoy our game as much as we do. Just by typing make, the executable will be created, with the name "game".

You can check cmd.txt in order to see the commands that are available in our game, and if you want to pass the game faster, with the command jump x (x is the id of the space where you want to go).

We would like to show you the game someday in person, so we can explain you more things about the game that maybe you don't realise at first sight. Have a good time!
